This application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) resembling Instagram, designed specifically for use on TVs at the Ag Center in Discovery Park of America. It offers a dynamic, real-time feed experience, mimicking the look and feel of Instagram. The interface updates dynamically with over 400 photos in its library, ensuring users encounter a unique viewing experience with every session. The application shuffles through the extensive photo collection to prevent repetition and enhance user engagement.
